# Methods are what python can do to strings

name = "ada lovelace" # note that this is all lowercase

print(name.upper()) # this converts to uppercase

print(name.lower()) # this appears to do nothing but it would convert all characters to lowercase

print(name.title()) # this applies Title Case, or capitalises the first letter of each word separated by spaces
